1. First of all I have worked on the functionality of the registration of the student.
    1.1 Primary Key is generated the random rollno and it will be never same
    1.2 Duplicat check of the student is bases on the aadhar no, before registrtion it is checked wheather the roll no are getting matched on not, incase of match rejection msg is shown to the registering staff.

2. Second functionality is to see the list of students, which has two options:
    2.1 See the list of all the students
    2.2 See the list of the students bases on their respective course

3. Third function I am going to build is add dues to the student by the staff. This also have two options:
    3.1 Add the same amount to all students, which can be done instantly for all
    3.2 Add based on the selective student based on the  roll no.
